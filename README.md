# LPV-attitude-control-of-a-reusable-launcher-during-re-entry-phase
This thesis, done in collaboration with AVIO S.P.A, presents a comprehensive study of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) control systems applied to launch and missile systems, integrating theoretical formulations with MATLAB-based simulations
The initial aim of the thesis was to concentrate on applying the research to reusable launchers. However, following consultations with specialists from AVIO and considering the abundance of existing literature, the focus was redirected towards the attitude control of benchmark missile dynamical models. The core of this research involves the development of LPV control laws within a specific structure tailored for launch vehicles and missile systems. These control laws are designed to effectively handle the nonlinearities inherent in missile systems and to minimize conservatism in control strategies. This approach ensures the missile's adaptability to varying flight conditions, such as changes in the Mach number or other parameters.

A significant methodological contribution reported in this thesis is the parameterization of the system's equilibrium points on a scheduling variable, $\rho$, which is influenced by both exogenous parameters ($\Theta$) and elements of the output vector ($y$). This parameterization is crucial for real-time updates of the system's operational conditions, especially for synthesis based on gain-scheduling through linearization techniques.

To validate the theoretical models, MATLAB simulations were conducted, encapsulated in the provided files \textit{Tesi2States.m} and \textit{Tesi5States.m}. These simulations encompass various missile models, with different input reference and different weights for the LPV controller, demonstrating the efficacy of the LPV control system in different scenarios. The MATLAB simulations were instrumental in testing the robustness of the LPV framework against different missile dynamics, enabling an empirical evaluation of the system's performance under varying flight conditions.

Furthermore, the thesis delves into the development of vector fields that define the system's dynamics, which are expanded using Taylor series around the family of equilibrium points. This development is critical for obtaining an LPV representation of the starting nonlinear system, effectively transforming it into a family of linearizations parameterized by $\rho(t)$. This representation is pivotal for analyzing the local behavior of the nonlinear system around specific equilibrium points.
This research bridges the gap between theoretical LPV control systems and practical applications in missile technology. The integration of MATLAB simulations with theoretical models provides a more practical view of the system's capabilities, demonstrating the potential of LPV control systems in enhancing the performance and reliability of missile systems under varying operational conditions. The outcomes of this study offer a contribution to the field of missile control systems, paving the way for more advanced, adaptable, and efficient metodologies.
